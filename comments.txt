IDENTIFY SYNTAX ERRORS:
  • What was wrong?
  • Why is it a problem in JSON?
  • What did you change to fix it?

1. There is a variable declaration using const.
    This is a problem because variable declaration is not valid in JSON.
    To fix this, I removed const, enclosed invalidBookingJSON in double quotation marks, added a colon. 
    Also added a curly brace in front of it. So it looks like:
    {"invalidBookingJSON" : {...

2. Missing comma between "checkInDate" and "checkOutDate".
    This is a problem because JSON requires commas between properties.
    To fix this, I added a comma after "2024-05-15".

3. Unquoted property name in "guests" array at index 0.
    This is a problem because JSON keys must always be in double quotes.
    To fix this, I wrapped double quotation marks around name. -> "name": "Alice Johnson"

4. In "guests" array, at index 1, "age" value is "undefined".
    This is a problem because undefined is not valid in JSON.
    To fix this, I changed undefined to "null".

5. In "roomDetails" object, the key property "amenities" array has a trailing comma.
    This is a problem because JSON does not allow trailing commas.
    To fix this, I removed the comma after "Parking".

6. There are backticks in the code.
    This is a problem because backticks are not valid in JSON.
    To fix this, I simply removed both backticks.
